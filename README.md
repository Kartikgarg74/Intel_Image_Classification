# Intel_Image_Classification
This project performs image classification on the Intel Image Classification dataset using DenseNet169. It compares training from scratch vs. fine-tuning with pre-trained ImageNet weights. Techniques like image augmentation, callback functions, and transfer learning are used to improve model performance, with results evaluated on accuracy.
